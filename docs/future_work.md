# Future Work

This section outlines several promising directions for extending and enhancing the PUF simulation and analysis framework. These ideas aim to broaden the scope of the project, improve usability, and increase the realism and robustness of the experimental platform.

## 1. Adding RO-PUF and SRAM-PUF Subclasses

While the current implementation focuses on the Arbiter PUF, two other widely studied PUF architectures are the Ring Oscillator PUF (RO-PUF) and the SRAM PUF. Incorporating these as subclasses would enable comparative studies and more comprehensive benchmarking.

- **RO-PUF:** This PUF type exploits the frequency variation of identically designed ring oscillators due to manufacturing randomness. A typical RO-PUF consists of multiple ring oscillators; the challenge selects a pair, and the response is determined by which oscillator is faster. Modeling RO-PUFs would involve simulating frequency distributions, environmental sensitivity, and possibly the effects of correlated noise.

- **SRAM-PUF:** SRAM PUFs leverage the random power-up state of SRAM cells as a unique fingerprint. Implementing an SRAM-PUF subclass would require simulating the start-up behavior of SRAM arrays, including bit-flip probabilities under environmental stressors. This would also open the door to studying helper data algorithms and fuzzy extractors for key generation.

By supporting these additional PUF types, the framework would become a more versatile tool for both academic research and practical evaluation.

## 2. Voltage and Aging Stressor Models

Currently, only temperature-induced variations are modeled. However, real-world PUFs are also affected by supply voltage fluctuations and device aging:

- **Voltage Stressor:** Voltage changes can alter the delay characteristics of PUF circuits. A voltage stressor model could be implemented by scaling the delay parameters according to a voltage sensitivity coefficient, similar to the temperature model. This would allow simulation of undervoltage and overvoltage attacks, as well as normal operational drift.

- **Aging Stressor:** Over time, semiconductor devices experience wear-out mechanisms (e.g., NBTI, HCI) that gradually shift their electrical properties. An aging model could incrementally perturb the PUF parameters based on simulated operational hours or stress cycles, enabling long-term reliability studies and the evaluation of aging-resilient PUF designs.

These extensions would make the simulation environment more realistic and valuable for lifecycle analysis.

## 3. Side-Channel and Fault-Injection Attack Modules

To further assess the security of PUFs, the framework could be extended with modules for:

- **Side-Channel Attacks:** These attacks exploit information leaked through power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, or timing. Implementing side-channel models would involve simulating such leakages and providing attackers with partial or noisy side-channel traces. This would enable the study of machine learning-based side-channel attacks and countermeasures.

- **Fault-Injection Attacks:** By deliberately introducing faults (e.g., via voltage glitches or laser pulses), attackers can manipulate PUF behavior. A fault-injection module could allow users to specify fault models and injection points, and observe the impact on PUF responses and system security.

These attack modules would provide a more complete picture of PUF vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of proposed defenses.

## 4. GUI Prototype Using PySide-6

A graphical user interface (GUI) would greatly enhance the accessibility and usability of the framework, especially for educational purposes and rapid prototyping. Using PySide-6 (the official Python bindings for Qt 6), a cross-platform GUI could be developed to:

- Allow users to configure PUF parameters, select stressors, and run experiments interactively.
- Visualize challenge-response behavior, attack results, and reliability metrics in real time.
- Export plots and data for further analysis.

A modular GUI would also facilitate integration with hardware testbeds or remote servers, broadening the potential user base.

## 5. Continuous Integration and Docker Packaging

To ensure code quality and reproducibility, the following DevOps enhancements are recommended:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Set up GitHub Actions workflows to automatically run unit tests, linting, and documentation builds on every commit and pull request. This will help catch regressions early and maintain high code standards.

- **Docker Packaging:** Provide a Dockerfile that encapsulates all dependencies and environment settings. This would allow users to run the entire framework in a containerized, reproducible environment, regardless of their host OS. Docker images could be published to Docker Hub for easy access.

Together, these improvements would streamline development, facilitate collaboration, and make the framework more robust and user-friendly for the broader research community.
